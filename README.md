# Ascend Nashville
  <p align="center">
    This project is a cloud native web application designed for a local indoor rock climbing gym, Ascend Nashville. The landing page is viewable
    by the public and includes available climbing routes and gym announcements. Gym employees can be provided an account. Once logged in, employees
    can view the public page as well as create, update, and delete routes and events as they change.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Context
This project was a cap-stone individual project completed at the Nashville Software School. I was given 5 weeks to design and implement
following strict technical requirements. In the first week I completed my design and design review for approval. The next 3 weeks I
spent building the project functionality. The back end is build with JAVA. The front end is built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. All data is stored in
Amazon DynamoDB. The routes and announcements are dynamically populated through API's that connect from the front end to the back end then 
querying DynamoDB using API Gateway. The final week I spent tinkering with the front end design and layout. Since this boot camp was 
all back end with JAVA, I was required to learn the front end on my own as needed to build a complete project. 

### What I learned
With this being my first solo project, I learned that I can actually built a fully functioning cloud-native web application! Writing all the code, front end and back end, API design, unit tests, initial design, deployment, debugging along the way, and persevering was all done on my own...an accomplishment that I am very proud
to have achieved. My ability to debug on the front end improved over time through this project. I became comfortable designing a new API on paper and then implementing
it quickly. Likewise, I became comfortable thinking of new features and then implementing them through code. I learned that a design can change as you start to build out the structure and functionality of an application.
